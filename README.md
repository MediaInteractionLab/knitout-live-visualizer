# Knitout (Live) Visualizer

Visualizer for knitout files, javascript files that print knitout with `console.log`, and javascript files that output knitout using knitout-frontend-js. Includes code editing support so you can edit-and-test within the interface.

Highlighting a line of source code highlights the stitches made by that line.
Clicking a stitch should take you to the line of code that made that stitch (but this doesn't appear to be working at the moment).

`visualizer.html` is the does-everything visualizer

`simplified-visualizer.html` only handles knitout files and doesn't have a code editor
